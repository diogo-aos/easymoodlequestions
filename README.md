Tired of Moodle's clunky UI for adding questions when all you need is simple multiple choice questions with a single correct answer?
This is for you. Write your questions, fast, in Excel, LibreOffice Calc or any other spreadsheet program and save the questions as a Tab Seperated Value (TSV) file.

Then convert that TSV file to something Moodle can understand with this service.

# Excel format
| Question text | correct answer | 1st | 2nd | 3rd | 4th | 5th | ... |
| ------------- | -------------- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| What is the correct answer?  | 2 | Answer A. | Answer B. | Answer C. | Answer D. | Answer E. | ... |

Having the correct answer as 2 will select "Answer B." as the correct answer.
If it were 1, it would be "Answer A."
You can have has has many answers as you want.
You can have as many questions in a single file as you want.


# Coming soon
1. A different format where the correct answer is marked with some word like "(CORRECT)".
2. Reading directly from Excel files.
